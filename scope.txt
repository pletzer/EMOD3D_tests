    1. Create a GIT repository for code and test inputs and implement 
       a structured environment for effective collaboration

    2. Build Emod3d code on Fitzroy and verify - rerun small/large 
       input data and compare timings and output with BG/P

    3. Profile the code to identify performance bottlenecks 
    
    4. Meet the performance target (3~4 times of BG/P speed for 
       the same number of cores used) 

    8. Train PI and the team to run the simulation on Fitzroy
